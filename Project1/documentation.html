    <h2>Controls</h2>
    <p>The controls are displayed in an intuitive in-game tutorial, walking the player through step by step</p>
    <p>WASD to move, Mouse click for throwing ball, C to enable free camera, X for fixed camera, R for restart, and L for full game restart</p>
    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <h3>KeyLogging</h3>
    <p>A basic game loop was set up, and key events were logged into an array and used in the update loop (see resources).</p>
    <h3>Level Objects</h3>
    <p>All of the platforms and different types of buttons or checkpoints are all stored into an array of rectangles. Each of the
        classes has an activate method, which runs when the platform is collided with. This allowed me to call the activate methods when I check for collisions.
        The methods for adding a platform to the screen as well as the methods for setting up activate calls were all written generally so that anything could be put into them. For 
        example, an Additive Button can create Subtractive button, which could subtract a Label Button, or any other combination that the designer desires.
    </p>
    <h3>Collisions</h3>
    <p>Since Brake Out is a platformer, simple bounding box intersection wouldn't work, I needed to know along what axis the collisions occur, As such 
        collisions are handled by projecting a rectangle where the player is attempting to move, seperating the x and the y into two seperate checks, seeing if the projected rectangle intersects anything. The player is then moved in the 
    x and y if their respective methods return true. </p>
    <h3>Tutorial</h3>
    <p>There is a hidden type of button in the game, the Label button. This button creates and displays a label, with tutorial text when the button is activated. I have the 
        color of these buttons set to the same value as the platforms, allowing the tutorial to mesh with the game, and follow the player down the levels.
    </p>

    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p>Pixi.js is used to render everything, and the game logic is coded in Javascript.
        The basic game loop came from the Circle Blast HW, and the Key logging technique I used is from Prof. Dower Chin's youtube tutorial series</p>
